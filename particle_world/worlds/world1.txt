/*************************************
possible shape commands:
	box, sphere, cylinder, torus [smallRadius]
(the torus-model (bigRadius=1) has as standard: smallRadius=0.25 !)
possible matrix transformations (multiplied):
	scaling [x] [y] [z] (y and z are optional)
	translation [x] [y] [z] (y and z are optional)
	rotation [x] [y] [z] (x,y,z are radian angles)
	rotationAxis [axisX] [axisY] [axisZ] [angle]
	rotationFromTo [fromX] [fromY] [fromZ] [toX] [toY] [toZ]
possible direction commands: (BEWARE OF ZERO-NORMALIZATIONS!)
IMPORTANT: direction- and strength-commands should be considered to work within the
standard bounds of the shape (most often the unit cube: x,y,z[-1,1])
	constant [vector]
	pointCentered [pointPositionVector]
	lineCentered [linePositionVector] [lineDirectionVector]
	planeCentered [planePositionVector] [planeNormalVector]
	torusCentered [centerVector] [normalVector= 0 1 0] [bigRadius = 1]
	resistance (anti-velocity direction)
	cross [vector] (acceleration = velocityVector X vector)
	randomOrtho (a random vector, orthogonal to velocity)
possible strength commands:
	constant [constantAcceleration]
	distPoint [inner] [outer] [radius(rangeLength)] [centerVector= 0 0 0]
	distLine  [inner] [outer] [linePositionVector] [lineDirectionVector] [radius(rangeLength)]
	distPlane [inner] [outer] [planePositionVector] [planeNormalVector] [radius(rangeLength)=1]
	distTorus [inner] [outer] [smallTorusRadius] [bigTorusRadius(rangeLength)=1] [torusPlanePositionVector= 0 0 0] [torusPlaneNormalVector= 0 1 0]
	dragTurbulence [density] [area=1.0] [dragCoefficient=2.0]
	dragViscosity [fluidViscosity] [radius=1/(6Pi)]
